## Installation
**Prerequisites**
**Node.js** - v18.14.1 or higher.

1. Fork the repository first.
2. `git clone` the forked repository on your computer.
3. Run `npm install` and `npm start`

## Project structure
**Patchstack Documentation** is built on top of [**Astro**🚀](https://astro.build/) and [**Astro Starlight**✨](https://starlight.astro.build/).
```
.
├── public/
├── src/
│   ├── assets/
│   ├── content/
│   │   ├── docs/
│   │   └── config.ts
|   ├── libs
|   ├── pages
|   ├── styles
│   └── env.d.ts
├── astro.config.mjs
├── package.json
└── tsconfig.json
```

The part that should interest you the most is the `src/content/docs` folder. All the website content is there in Markdown or MDX format.

## Commands
All commands are run from the root of the project, from a terminal:

| Command                   | Action                                           |
| :------------------------ | :----------------------------------------------- |
| `npm install`             | Installs dependencies                            |
| `npm run dev`             | Starts local dev server at `localhost:4321`      |
| `npm run build`           | Build your production site to `./dist/`          |
| `npm run preview`         | Preview your build locally, before deploying     |
| `npm run astro ...`       | Run CLI commands like `astro add`, `astro check` |
| `npm run astro -- --help` | Get help using the Astro CLI                     |

## Deploying
There is no manual deploy step. Netlify watches this repository:

- Every push to `main` (including merged pull requests) is built and published to [docs.patchstack.com](https://docs.patchstack.com) automatically.
- Every pull request gets a Netlify Deploy Preview; the link is posted as a comment and status check on the PR.

This repository has no GitHub Actions workflows, so there is nothing to run or check on the Actions tab. Build settings live in the Netlify project; `netlify.toml` only holds redirect rules.
