From the settings subpage, you can get your API key that needs to be inserted to the plugin.  
If your site URL changes, you can change it from the same page.

You can also download the Patchstack plugin .zip file here by clicking **Download latest version** . Note that this plugin file will come with pre-inserted API key, so you can use the same .zip file for only this particular WordPress application.

## How to upload the plugin to WordPress

To upload the plugin to your WordPress application:

- Go to your WordPress administration page
- Navigate to **Plugins** > **Add New**
- Click on **Upload Plugin**
- Upload the .zip file from there
- Click **Activate** after uploading the plugin
