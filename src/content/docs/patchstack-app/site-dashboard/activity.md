The activity logs display a large number of events that occur on your WordPress application. They are stored for 12 months after which they are archived.

On the **Activity** page, you can:

1. Enable / disable the activity log  
   _Disabling the activity log is useful, when your site has a lot of activity. For example, the activity log database may become too large on dropshipping ecommerce sites, where huge amounts of products are being constantly imported. On such sites, we'd recommend disabling the activity logs._
2. Enable / disable logging the failed logins  
   _This will store the failed login entries WordPress activity logs database_
3. Enable / disable uploading the failed login logs to Patchstack  
   _This will sync the failed login entries from WordPress activity logs database to Patchstack App logs_
4. See, what sort of activities have been done on the site.
5. Search for activities by username or IP addresses
