On the **Software** overview page, you can see all the components (plugins, themes, and WordPress core) that each of your applications uses.  
The table shows, which of the components are vulnerable and which are just outdated.  
Components that are grayed-out, are deactivated on the website.

## Updating the software

You can update your components on that page. Keep in mind to backup your files and databases before doing that.  
If you wish to update components individually, you can select those one by one by clicking on the checkbox on the left column. After that, click on **Action** > **Update**.  
Your software versions should start updating on your WordPress applications immediately.

Another way is to bulk update all software components across all your apps. For that, click the green **Update All** button. You will be asked for confirmation.
