In order to add an intranet site to the Patchstack App, you have to do a few different steps until we properly support it.

We are still working on supporting intranet sites properly:

Because the site is not accessible from the public, you first have to add a random domain name to your account that exists on the public internet. After that, go to **My Sites** > yourdomain.com > Settings. Change the URL to the URL of your intranet site.

After that, refresh the page and install the Patchstack plugin [manually](/getting-started/installing-patchstack/installing-via-wordpress-repository/).
