Currently, Patchstack sends notifications only to the user, who is the **owner** or **manager** of the site. But in case you would like to get notified to other email addresses, you can set up the custom alerts!

Note that custom alerts is a feature for Developer or Enterprise plan accounts only.

## Setting up an email alert

<ol><li>Navigate to the <a href="https://app.patchstack.com/alerts/latest" target="_blank"><b>Alerts</b></a> page from Patchstack App</li>
<li>On the top right corner, click on <b>+ Create Trigger</b> button</li>
<li>Give your trigger a title (e.g. Notification to Joe)</li>
<li>Choose the condition of when the alert is triggered. If you want to alert this email about found vulnerabilities, pick "Vulnerable" from the list</li>
<li>Choose <b>Email Notification</b> and enter the email</li>
</ol>

If you have multiple people you wish to send notifications to, you will need to repeat the process and add another email address.
