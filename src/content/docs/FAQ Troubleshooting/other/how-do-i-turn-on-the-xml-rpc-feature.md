XML-RPC should no longer be used, but your site might still make use of it.  
As of April 10th 2019, we added a new option that blocks access to XML-RPC by default.

In order to turn it back on:

<ol>
<li>Go to Patchstack App > <b>My Apps</b> > <b>yourdomain.com</b> > <b>Hardening</b></li>
<li>Scroll down a bit and uncheck the <b>Restrict XML-RPC Access</b></li>
<li>Click <b>"Save Settings"</b></li>
</ol>
