You can generate a website security report for each website you have connected with Patchstack App.  
Find the reports by you logging into your account and looking for Reports from your left-side menu in the Patchstack App.

Patchstack offers two types of security reports:

- Snapshot report  
  Snapshot report is a current situational report of the website.
- Developer report (for Developer and Enterprise plan users)  
  The developer report is a periodic PDF security report. It means you will need to pick a time period (for example a month), in which the data about your site is shown on the report.
