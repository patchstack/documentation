The Patchstack plugin adds a reCaptcha to your login page, but it may not work with other plugins.

Patchstack, by default, has the reCaptcha feature turned off. You can pick to which pages you would like to add the reCAPTCHA; login, register, forgot password, and comments.

Note that Patchstack's reCaptcha only works with WordPress's built-in forms and not for other plugins (e.g e-commerce registration forms).

If you turn this feature on and have a different plugin installed that has the same kind of functionality, you may get locked out of your WordPress application. In this scenario, you have to delete either plugin.
