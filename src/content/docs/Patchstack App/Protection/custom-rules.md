_Custom firewall rules are accessible for the Developer and Business plan users only._  

Navigate to the custom firewall rules page by visiting **Protection** > **Custom rules**, or click here:
[https://app.patchstack.com/protection/rules](https://app.patchstack.com/protection/rules)

On the custom rules page, you'll see an overview of which rules you have created and to which sites are these attached to. You can use this page to attach / detach rules from your sites, or change the rules.

To begin creating a new custom firewall rule, click on **+ Create rule** button at the top of the page.

Note that after creating and attaching the custom firewall rule to your site, it may take some time before it takes effect. Alternatively, you can initiate a manual re-sync between Patchstack App and your site, by clicking on **Re-sync** button at the top of this page.
