_Custom firewall rules (including simple rules) are available for Patchstack Developer and Enterprise plan users._  

Navigate to the simple firewall rules page by visiting **Protection** > **Custom rules** > **+ Create rule**, or click here:

We have crafted some ready-made custom firewall rule templates, which are easy to implement on your sites.
The templates are made for the following rules:
* Whitelist IP addresses
* Whitelist if URL contains
* Block single IP address
* Block multiple IP addresses
* Block HTTP user agent if it contains a certain word
