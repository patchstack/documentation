_Groups feature is available for all Patchstack paid plan users._

Grouping makes it easier to distinguish the sites from each other.
You can attach your sites to multiple groups.  

For example, if you sell care plans, you can group your sites by care plan names.

## Creating a group

To create a group, click on a plus sign at the groups column in the <a href="https://app.patchstack.com/sites" target="_blank">**Sites**</a> view of Patchstack App. 
You can give this group a name and attach it to your site.

## Attaching a group

You can attach an existing group to any site, by clicking the **plus sign**, and start typing the already existing group name. Then, click on the group name to attach it to that site.

## Removing a group
Once a group has been assigned to a site, it cannot be edited. However, you can remove the existing group and create a new one. To do this, hover over the group name until an "X" appears, then click on it to remove the group.
