<Aside type="note">
	This feature is only available to WordPress.  
	It is available in Patchstack plugin versions starting from and including 2.3.5.
</Aside>
<br />
It is possible to set a default site policy for all your sites. The default site policy consists of a JSON array of settings that will be applied to the WordPress site upon the initial activation of the Patchstack plugin.

## Setting up a default policy
1. Head to [https://app.patchstack.com/settings/integrations](https://app.patchstack.com/settings/integrations)
2. Scroll down to the "Default Site Policy" section.
3. Modify the JSON list and add or adjust the list per your needs.
4. Click the "Save Policy" button.

All of the options that can be set can be found [here](/patchstack-plugin/wp-options/) under "Patchstack WordPress Options".  
Note that some options cannot be set, in particular dynamic options which change often.

## Example policy
An example policy, to strictly run the Patchstack firewall engine, can be seen below.
By default, a lot of the Patchstack hardening features are opt-in which means we only have to adjust few settings.

```json
{
	"patchstack_disable_htaccess": 1,
	"patchstack_basicscanblock": 0,
	"patchstack_prevent_default_file_access": 0,
	"patchstack_index_views": 0,
	"patchstack_block_debug_log_access": 0,
	"patchstack_pluginedit": 0,
	"patchstack_userenum": 0,
	"patchstack_hidewpversion": 0,
	"patchstack_application_passwords_disabled": 0,
	"patchstack_xmlrpc_is_disabled": 0,
	"patchstack_add_security_headers": 0,
	"patchstack_activity_log_is_enabled": 0,
	"patchstack_activity_log_failed_logins": 0
}
```

## Considerations
- For team accounts, the leader's policy will always apply, except for "independent" seats as their policy will be applied instead.
- The policy can also be programmatically set through the [Patchstack App API](/api-solutions/app-api/patchstack-app-api/).
- The policy will only be applied during the first activation of the WordPress plugin.
	- This avoids overwriting settings that were manually configured in the past.
