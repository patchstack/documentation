Navigate to **Protection** > **Banned IPs** section to view all the IP addresses that are currently banned from visiting the site. In case it's a false positive blocking, you can unblock this IP by selecting **Action** > **Unban**. 

Mostly, these IPs got blocked temporarily, after these bots or hackers were shown the Error 22 page on your site.
