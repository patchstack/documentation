_Seats and team features are available on the Developer and Business plan users only._  

To manage your seats and team settings, click on your name on Patchstack App (at the bottom left corner of the screen), then navigate to the **Seats** page, or click here: https://app.patchstack.com/team

On the **Seats** page you can manage the seats. The seat management feature allows you to add sub-users to your account to which you can assign specific permissions and/or sites.  
When you add a new user, they will receive an email with a link to activate their account.
