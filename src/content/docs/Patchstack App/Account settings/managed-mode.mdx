_The managed by text feature is for the Enterprise plan only and applies to WordPress sites._  

As an enterprise user, you will have the ability to set a custom message that will be shown to your customers when they visit the /wp-admin/ page and head to Settings → Security.

## Setting up managed by text
1. Head to the [integrations page](https://app.patchstack.com/settings/integrations).
2. Locate the "Site Managed By Text" section.
3. Enter the HTML which you want to display to your users.

It can take up to 24 hours before the managed by text and mode is activated if applied for the first time. By clicking the API key resync button on Settings → Security at /wp-admin/, it will instantly refresh on the website.

## Allowed HTML
There are some limitations on what HTML is allowed to be inserted into this textarea. The HTML is passed through WordPress' wp_kses function with the allowed HTML and attributes in the list below.

## Example
Below is an example of what this looks like on the /wp-admin/ → Settings → Security page if we were to set the message to the following:

```html
The security of this website is managed by <span style="color: #fff;">SomeCompany</span>.<br>
If you have any questions or need assistance, reach out to us at <a href="mailto:our@company.com">our@company.com</a>.
```
