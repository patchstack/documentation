_Reports scheduling is a feature for the Developer and Business plan users only._

To view the scheduled security reports or schedule new reports, navigate to  
**Reports** > **Scheduled reports** in Patchstack App, or click here: [https://app.patchstack.com/reports/scheduled](https://app.patchstack.com/reports/scheduled)

If you have clients to whom you want to send PDF security reports regularly, scheduling the reports can be highly beneficial. The reports will be generated automatically and can be accessed from the Patchstack App at any time.  
Reports will be available for downloading on the Reports page.

## Creating a report schedule

1. Go to the **Reports** page in Patchstack App
2. Click on the **+ Create Schedule** button at the top of the screen
3. You will see a popup as such: ![](@images/patchstack-scheduling-reports.png)
4. Pick your site URL from the left dropdown menu. You can then choose to schedule the reports two ways:
    * Monthly, on the 1st
    * Weekly, on Mondays
5. If you are on a **Business plan**, you can also customize some report settings and upload your customer logo, which will be shown on the reports.
6. Having done your choices, click **Create**.

## Editing a report schedule

To edit a schedule, head to the **Scheduled reports** tab on the **Reports** page.

If you are a **Business plan user**, you can toggle the switches in order to customize the data shown on the PDF reports. Also, it is possible to upload the customer logo, so it will be shown on the reports.

After making the changes, click on **Save** button at the top right corner.
