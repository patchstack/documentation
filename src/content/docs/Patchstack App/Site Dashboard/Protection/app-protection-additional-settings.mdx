## Additional settings features

### User role whitelist

You can whitelist user types from the Patchstack firewall engine. This means that the Patchstack firewall would not run against these user types at all. To whitelist any user type, do the following:
<Steps>
1. Navigate to your sites' **Protection** > **Additional settings** page in Patchstack App
2. Look for the **User role whitelist** section
3. Toggle the roles, that you wish to whitelist
4. Click **Save settings** once the changes have been done.
</Steps>
### Country blocking

In case you want to block traffic to your site from certain countries, you can do so in the **Country blocking** section.

To block any country from viewing your site, do the following:
<Steps>
1. Navigate to your sites' **Protection** > **Additional settings** page in Patchstack App
2. Look for the **Country blocking** section
3. Toggle the **Enable country blocking** switch
3. Start typing the name of the country into the country list field
4. Click on the country name
5. Scroll down and click on **Save settings**
</Steps>
### Inversed country blocking
Patchstack has also added the option which inverses the country blocking.
When "Turn it into whitelist" is checked, the countries which are typed into the country list input, will be the only countries from which the traffic to your site is allowed.

**Example case:**  
If you want to allow traffic ONLY from (for example) Germany: 

<Steps>
1. Type "Germany" into **country input field**
2. Check **Turn it into whitelist instead**
3. Check **Enable country blocking**
4. Click on **Save settings**
</Steps>

PS! In some rare occurrences, the country blocking feature can cause false positive blockings. We rather recommend using country blocking on a server level.

### General whitelist settings

Under the **General whitelist settings** section, you can manage whitelist settings and add IP address header override rule.

> #### ðŸ“˜ Whitelist
> 
> Each rule must be on a new line.
> 
> The following keywords are accepted  
> IP:IPADDRESS  
> PAYLOAD:someval  
> URL:/someurl
> 
> Definitions  
> IP = firewall will not run against the IP  
> PAYLOAD = if the entire payload contains the keyword, the firewall will not proceed  
> URL = if the URL contains given URL, firewall will not proceed
> 
> Example  
> IP:192.168.1.1  
> PAYLOAD:contact_form  
> URL:water  
> URL:/some-form
> 
> In this scenario, the firewall will not run if the IP address is 192.168.1.1 or if the payload contains contact_form or if the URL contains water or if the URL contains /some-form.

> #### ðŸ“˜ IP Address Header Override
> 
> If you would like to override the IP address header that we use to grab the IP address of the visitor, enter the value to IP Address Header Override input.
> 
> This must be a valid value in the $\_SERVER array, for example HTTP_X_FORWARDED_FOR. If the $\_SERVER value you enter does not exist, it will fallback to the Patchstack IP grab function so ask your hosting company if you are unsure.
> 
> Leave this empty to use the Patchstack IP address grabbing function.

### Block IP settings

In this section, you can Block IPs that are a potential threat to your sites.
