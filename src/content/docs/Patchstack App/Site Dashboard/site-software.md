On the **Software** subpage, you can manage all the software components of your site.
The following actions are available:

<ul>
<li>Enable auto-updates for:
<ul><li>Only vulnerable software</li><li>All core, themes and plugins</li></ul></li>
<li>Have an overview of software your site is using and see all your software versions</li>
<li>See if any of the software is found vulnerable or outdated</li>
<li>Update, activate, deactivate, or delete the existing plugins/themes</li>
<li>Update all your software with one click</li>
<li>Force resynchronization between Patchstack App and your site if something looks out of sync</li></ul>

### To perform any actions with specific plugins or themes on your site, follow the steps below:

<ol><li>
Check the checkboxes of your plugins or themes (at the left side of the table row)</li>
<li>Click on the <b>Actions</b> button next to the search bar</li>
<li>You can then pick one of the following actions to perform with your selected plugins or themes:
  <ol>
    <li>Update</li>
    <li>Activate</li>
    <li>Deactivate</li>
    <li>Delete</li>
  </ol>
</li>
</ol>

Plugins and themes that are grayed out, are currently deactivated on the website, or cannot be updated via third party apps like Patchstack (like premium licensed software, which use non-standard updating mechanisms).

### Update all your software with one click 
You can update components altogether by clicking the **Update All** button.  
Just keep in mind to **back up your files and database** before doing that.
