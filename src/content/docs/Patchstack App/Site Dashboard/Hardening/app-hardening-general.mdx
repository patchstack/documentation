On this page you can manage the following hardening settings:

<Steps>
1. **Disable the theme editor** - this feature could protect you from potential automated attacks that involve the theme editor
2. **Remove readme.html from the WordPress root folder** - this will attempt to stop basic readme.html scans by bots or visitors
3. **Block readme.txt access**
4. **Disable user enumeration** - this feature blocks hackers from getting your WordPress usernames
5. **Hide WordPress version** - this feature removes the WordPress version in the &lt;meta> tag in the HTML output
6. **Block WordPress application password feature** - this feature disables the application passwords feature introduced in WordPress 5.6
7. **Restrict XML-RPC Access** - this feature restricts access to xmlrpc.php by only allowing authenticated users to access it
8. **Restrict WP REST API Access** - this feature restricts access to the WP Rest API by only allowing authenticated users to access it
</Steps>
