_Login protection is available for all Patchstack paid plan users._  
**_Protection is available for WordPress sites only._**

To manage your WordPress site's login protection, and set up 2FA (two factor authentication) for it, navigate to **Sites** > **yourdomain.com** > **Hardening** > **Login protection** in Patchstack App.

On the **Login protection** subpage you can:

<ul>
<li>Block access to default /wp-admin page and set up a custom login URL</li>
<li>Ban IPs that fail on multiple login attempts</li>
<li>Enable WordPress users to set up the 2FA from WordPress profile page</li>
<li>Add IP addresses to WordPress login whitelist</li>
<li>Block certain IP addresses from being able to log into WordPress</li>
</ul>

## How our custom login URL feature works

If you define a new URL for login, it works like a security token for your wp-admin. Entering your custom URL once, will whitelist your IP to access regular wp-admin URL again.

### Example usage:

Let's say you enter **"myadmin"** to the **New URL** field.  
To log in to your WordPress admin panel, you need to:

<Steps>
1. First visit your secret URL (for example **yourdomain.com/myadmin**)
2. Your IP gets whitelisted
3. You can now log in from the regular **yourdomain.com/wp-admin** again
3. Other visitors are blocked from wp-admin page, unless they know your security token (in this case /myadmin)
</Steps>
