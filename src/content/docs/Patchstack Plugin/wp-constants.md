Patchstack has introduced WordPress constants which can be used in wp-config.php file.

### Disable writing to .htaccess
To prevent Patchstack from writing rules to the .htaccess file, add the following constant to your wp-config.php file. If rules were previously added to your .htaccess file via the Patchstack App, you will need to remove them manually.

```
define('PS_DISABLE_HTACCESS', true);
```

### Disable mu-plugin creation

Patchstack automatically creates a mu-plugin upon installation. To prevent automatic mu-plugin creation, define the PS_DISABLE_MU constant in your wp-config.php file.

```
define('PS_DISABLE_MU', true);
```
