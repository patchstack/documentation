You can deactivate and uninstall the Patchstack plugin just like any other WordPress plugin.  
We recommend uninstalling it from the WordPress admin panel to have the plugin and its data correctly removed from the server (files and database entries).

After successful deletion, the \*\_options table will be the only table that keeps the plugin settings data. So the next time you install Patchstack on the same site, your plugin data will be there again (including the API key).

To deactivate, go to your **Plugins** page, find **Patchstack Security**, click on **Deactivate** and then **Delete**
