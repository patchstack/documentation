## Finalizing your first software setup

After submitting the form, you'll be taken to your added software page. This page will show all the vulnerability and reports statistics about your software in the future.

Before Patchstack can validate your software, you will have to add a VDP disclaimer to your software readme.txt or security.md file in GitHub. The disclaimer can be copied, by clicking the **Copy disclaimer for...** button.

_If you don't have your project present on the WordPress repository, please e-mail us for verification at triage@patchstack.com_

## Adding a disclaimer on different platforms
Depending on the platform you are using to host you software, you will have to add the VDP disclaimer in different places. Here are some best practices for how to do it. 

:::tip[]
Make sure that the disclaimer is visible and easy to find for security researchers.
:::

### WordPress repository
You should add the disclaimer to your `readme.txt` file. The most common place is to add it add it to FAQ section. 

### GitHub / Gitlab / Bitbucket
You should add the disclaimer to your `security.md` and the `readme.md` file. If you don't have those files, you can create them in the root of your repository.

### Envato Marketplace
You should add the disclaimer either to the main description of your component or add it to the **support** tab.

### Product website
All websites are different, so there is no one-size-fits-all solution. However we recommend createing a dedicated page for security (e.g. **security** or **report security issues**) and adding the VDP disclaimer there. Next, you should link to this page from the footer of your website, so that it is easy to find.

If you have more components, you can put all the disclaimers on that page.

## Example disclaimer
This is an example disclaimer, do not paste it to your software, as it includes an example link.
You should copy the disclaimer straight from the mVDP platform by clicking the **Copy disclaimer for...** button.
