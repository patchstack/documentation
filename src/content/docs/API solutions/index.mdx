Patchstack offers two different APIs for building custom tools and integrating our data to third party solutions.

## Patchstack App API
Patchstack App API can be used commercially for building custom tools and integrating third party platforms with Patchstack App; Patchstack App API enables users to run all the Patchstack App account actions remotely. For example, it allows you to retrieve protection logs, generate security reports, manage site settings, add new sites, create custom rules, and much more. 
This API has unlimited requests and can be used by all Developer plan users for free.
