**Here are short descriptions of all our plans:** 

## Community Plan

The Community plan is a free plan, which by default lets you manage up to 10 web applications.  
This free version helps you to find out if any of your WordPress site's components have vulnerabilities. With Community plan, you can manage all the plugins and themes of your sites directly from the Patchstack App.  
The Community plan lets you protect your sites individually by enabling protection on the sites you want. Individual protection costs $5 / month per site.

**PRICING**  
Free, but you can optionally protect sites for $5 / month per site.
**NB!** By default, the Community plan has 10 site slots, but you can increase the amount of slots to 50 for $49 / month.
