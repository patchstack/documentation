Upload the plugin to your WordPress site, and click "Resync."
Patchstack will automatically sync if you upload the plugin within 30 minutes.


**What if I already have the Patchstack plugin on my site?** 

You can click **Sync manually**, and get the fresh API key.
Insert it into your plugin's API field and click on **Resync**.
